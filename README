Compilation
***********
Assuming that you are in the main folder's directory in the terminal:
make

******************
Running and Usage
******************
./main file.ics
(where file.ics is a calendar file you wish to parse)

************************
How the Program(s) Works
************************
This program implements a static library to parse iCalendar files. These files are created when make is called, and stored into the folder bin.
Information from the file will be extracted, parsed, and put through verification. Any errors encountered during parsing will result in the function
stopping and returning a value associated with that error.

*********************************
Known Limitations or Assumptions
*********************************
Memory Limits (if file is very large)
Assumptions made for calendar file format
